## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass
- JavaScript
- IntersectionObserver

### What I learned

This time, I wannted to test my css-grid skills in the second section,
I founded some usefull resources in [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/look-ma-no-media-queries-responsive-layouts-using-css-grid/) about responsive grids
without media queries, an interesting implementation.

This is the core from the implementation:

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(14rem, 1fr));
  grid-gap: 2rem;
```

A whole explatation can be founded in css-tricks.

By the way, I wanted to test the IntersectionObserver API. It allows me to make
some animations or changes in the code when the user observe the element. I've
used this tool to give it some movement to the grid items and the image and text
from the first-section.

Another thing I've learned, is how to iterate over an HTML collection. Use a simple
"for/in" loop doesn't work, cause it iterate over others elements, besides the HTML
tags; due to this situation, I had to find out how to iterate correctly. It the
solution was simple:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < frstSection.length; i++) {
  console.log(frstSection[i]);
  observer.observe(frstSection[i]);
}
```

Being "frstSection" the HTML collection. The ".length" method define the finall from
the loop. That's all.

### Continued development

I would like to order the animations in "interObs".
